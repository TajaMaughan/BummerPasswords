# Bummer Passwords
Bummer Passwords was built to help assist in remembering and creating passwords for all the different website you use. 
We used Firebase as our database. We utilized the email authentication to allow each user to have their own page of usernames and password. Afterall, you don't want everyone else to have access to that. Once you log in, you can update you profile page if you would like. ![profile page](BummerPasswords/assets/BummerPasswords/profile.png)
